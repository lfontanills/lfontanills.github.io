**Hi, I'm Laura.** I like telling stories with data.

As a student, I studied Earth Science, and I used data to tell a story about dead stuff sinking to the bottom of the sea. It was 70 pages long and contained a bunch of *really* tiny graphs. I had a lot to learn about data communication, and I spent 7 years as a science teacher doing just that.

As a teacher, I told stories about all kinds of science -- like how earthquake data reveals the internal structure of our planet,<sup>1</sup> and how heart rate data tells us about our homeostatic response to exercise.<sup>2</sup> I learned how to make scientific data accessible, and I loved it.

I also taught my students how to collect and interpret data, and how to tell their own stories from it -- like how many buckets of sand their model bridge could hold,<sup>3</sup> or what substances were floating in the weird puddle by their house,<sup>4</sup> or whether a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could actually kill you.<sup>5</sup>

Now, I'm making data my career. Check out the links below to see how I'm applying my skillset to new data projects. I hope you enjoy the stories I tell.
